"C6,C7, C9,",3,"1µF","Ceramic Capacitors   For new designs, use the packages preceded by an '_' character since they are more reliable:   The following footprints should be used on most boards: _0402 - Standard footprint for regular board layouts  _0603 - Standard footprint for regular board layouts  _0805 - Standard footprint for regular board layouts  _1206 - Standard footprint for regular board layouts       For extremely tight-pitch boards where space is at a premium, the following 'micro-pitch' footprints can be used (smaller pads, no silkscreen outline, etc.): _0402MP - Micro-pitch footprint for very dense/compact boards  _0603MP - Micro-pitch footprint for very dense/compact boards  _0805MP - Micro-pitch footprint for very dense/compact boards  _1206MP - Micro-pitch footprint for very dense/compact boards","CL10B105KQ8NNNC","C105524",,"C15849","C5673","587-2400-1-ND",
